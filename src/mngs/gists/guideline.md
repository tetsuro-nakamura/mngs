# A Guideline for New Programmers.

## Mentality
#### Embrace Automation
Automate repetitive steps; e.g., "A -> B -> C" to "A -> C".

#### Skill Over Knowledge
Programming is more of a skill rather than knowledge; it's like to learn hwo to ride a bycycle not learning the mechanisms of gears.

## Use English
No exceptions.

## Keyboard
#### Mouse < Keyboard
### Master Shortcuts
Shortcuts are often linked to English. You will realize a large number of software have common shortcuts.
### Stick to a Preferred Keyboard
Preferably [the HHKB Keyboard](https://www.pfuemea.com/en-gb/dr_product/hhkb-professional-hybrid-type-s-charcoal-45g-tkl-blank-keycaps-pd-kb800bns). Keyboard is the interface between you and computers; it is like an extension of your body.
#### Do not go away from the home position
"Ctrl + n" is better than "Enter".
#### Use the entire hand
The tip of your left hand is very suitable for pressing "Alt".


## Emacs --more than a editor--
The initial cost is high. But, the investment on Emacs will paid off exponentically.
#### Create shortcuts
Define shortcut keys by writing Elisp code. Regularly update the configuration files.
