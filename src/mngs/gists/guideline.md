# Guidelines for New Programmers.

## Preface
- #### Programming is all about Automation
  Automate repetitive steps; _e.g._, "A -> B -> C" to "A -> C".
- #### Programming is a skill
  Programming is not knowledge but a skill. To ride a bicycle, all you need is to ride a bicycle.

## Use English
- Read, write, and think in English.

## Keyboard
- #### Keyboard is better than mouse
- #### Shortcuts is the key to enhance your productivity
  Shortcuts are often linked to English. You will realize a large number of software have common shortcuts.
- #### Stick to ONE Keyboard
  Preferably [the HHKB Keyboard](https://www.pfuemea.com/en-gb/dr_product/hhkb-professional-hybrid-type-s-charcoal-45g-tkl-blank-keycaps-pd-kb800bns). Your keyboard is the interface between you and computers; you should regard it as an extension of your body.
- #### Do not go away from the home position
  "Ctrl + n" is better than "Enter".
- #### Use the entire hand
  The tip of your left hand is very suitable for pressing "Alt".


## Emacs —more than an editor—
- The initial cost to learn Emacs is high, but the investment will pay off exponentially.
- #### Create shortcuts
  Define shortcut keys by writing Elisp code. Regularly update the configuration files.

## Coding
- #### Interact with computers
  Observe inputs and outputs. Error code is your friend.
- #### Googlability
  If you have any comments or queries, feel free to visit [Google.com](https://www.google.com/) or press "Ctrl + K" on your browser. Finding suitable information on the Internet is a critical skill.
- #### ChatGPT
  Incorporate ChatGPT for your editor.

- #### Avoid Comments
  Code itself should be descriptive. Comments should help readers to understand "why" instead of "what".
