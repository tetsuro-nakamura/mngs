/home/ywatanabe/proj/mngs/src/mngs/plt/_subplots.py:84: RuntimeWarning: More than 20 figures have been opened. Figures created through the pyplot interface (`matplotlib.pyplot.figure`) are retained until explicitly closed and may consume too much memory. (To control this warning, see the rcParam `figure.max_open_warning`). Consider using `matplotlib.pyplot.close()`.
  fig, axes = plt.subplots(*args, **kwargs)
