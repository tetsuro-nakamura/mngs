    abstract = {The National Association of Epilepsy Centers (NAEC) recently published their updated guidelines for specialized epilepsy centers. The first NAEC guidelines provided basic expectations for in-patient care, with the goal of makingan accurate diagnosis and choose the best intervention- medical or surgical. With the 2001 report, the emphasis was for epilepsy centers to be able to provide comprehensive diagnostic and treatment services. The NAEC 2010 guidelines further delineated the essential elements of level 3 and 4 specialized epilepsy centers.The goal of the 2023 guidelines is not only to provide optimal standards of care, but also to "elevate evidence-based science into standard practice."4 Therefore, these are the first NAEC guidelines that are solely funded by NAEC and also the first founded on an evidence-informed, consensus-based process. The 2023 guidelines now include 52 recommendations across the following domains: Inpatient Services/EMU, Surgery, Diagnostic Evaluation, and Outpatient Services. The guidelines provide us with the recommendations when creating new centers or ways to improve our current centers. Well- documented guidelines such as these provide us with support when seeking additional financial and personnel resources. Put simply, these guidelines have provided us with the recipe for ideal comprehensive epilepsy care for PWE.}
