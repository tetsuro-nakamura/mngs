If BS has any independent therapeutic effect on RSE is disputed. We aimed to define EEG characteristics of BS predicting termination or recurrence of status after weaning. All RSE patients treated with IVAT while undergoing continuous EEG monitoring on the neurological intensive care unit between 2014 and 2019 were screened for inclusion. A one hour-period of visually preselected BS-EEG was analyzed. Bursts were segmented by a special thresholding technique and underwent power spectral analysis. Out of 48 enrolled patients, 25 (52.1 %) did not develop seizure recurrence (group Non SE) after weaning from IVAT; in 23 patients (47.9 %), SE reestablished (group SE). In group Non SE, bursts contained higher amounts of EEG delta power (91.59 % vs 80.53 %, p < 0.0001), while faster frequencies were more pronounced in bursts in group SE (theta: 11.38 % vs 5.41 %, p = 0.0008; alpha: 4.89 % vs 1.82 %, p < 0.0001; beta: 3.23 % vs 1.21 %, p = 0.0002). Spectral profiles of individual bursts closely resembled preceding seizure patterns in group SE but not in group Non SE. Accordingly, persistence of spectral composition of initial ictal patterns in bursts, suggests ongoing SE, merely interrupted but not altered by BS. Fast oscillations in bursts indicate a high risk of status recurrence after weaning from IVAT. EEG guided individualized sedation regimes might therefore be superior to standardized anesthesia protocols.}
